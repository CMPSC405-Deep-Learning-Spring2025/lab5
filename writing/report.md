# Lab 5 Report

## 1. RNN Architectures and Implementation

- **Core Architectures**: Explain the four RNN architectures (Deep GRU, Deep LSTM, Bidirectional GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM) you implemented and why you chose them.
- **Model Modifications**: Describe any modifications made to the base architectures (e.g., dropout, hidden size, number of layers).
- **Hardware Used**: State whether you used CPU or GPU and justify your choice.

## 2. Experiment Setup

- **Dataset Used**: Name the dataset, describe its sequential nature, number of classes (if applicable), and preprocessing steps (e.g., tokenization, sequence creation).
- **Model Selection**: Justify your selection of the four RNN architectures.
- **Experiment Variations**: Describe the two experiment variations you implemented (e.g., hidden size, depth, bidirectionality, dropout).
- **Hyperparameters**: Document the learning rate, batch size, optimizer, number of epochs, and any other relevant parameters.

## 3. Training and Validation Process

- **Training Details**: Number of training epochs and total training time for each model.
- **Performance Trends**: Loss and accuracy trends over epochs (include plots if possible) for each model.
- **Validation Results**: Validation accuracy or other metrics achieved for each model.
- **Challenges**: Discuss any challenges faced during training (e.g., overfitting, convergence issues) for each model.

## 4. Experiment Results and Model Comparisons

- **Accuracy Comparison**: Include a table comparing accuracy (or other metrics) for each model and experiment variation.
- **Loss Trends**: Provide graphs comparing loss curves for each model.
- **Output Analysis**: For sequential outputs (e.g., text generation), include sample outputs and discuss differences between models.
- **Feature Analysis**: Discuss how architectural choices (e.g., bidirectionality, depth) impacted the results.

## 5. Experimental Variations

- **Variation 1**: Describe the first variation (e.g., hidden size, depth) and its impact on performance.
- **Variation 2**: Describe the second variation (e.g., dropout, sequence length) and its impact on performance.
